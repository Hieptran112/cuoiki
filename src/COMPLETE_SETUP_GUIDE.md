   - Select any deck (e.g., "Essential Vocabulary")
   - Study cards using the flip interface
   - Rate cards (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
   - Check spaced repetition algorithm

2. **Statistics** (`stats.php`)
   - View flashcard statistics
   - Check deck breakdown
   - Verify study progress synchronization

3. **Listening** (`listening.php`)
   - Try listening exercises
   - Test text-to-speech audio

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**1. "Table doesn't exist" errors**
```bash
# Solution: Run table creation first
php src/robust_database_setup.php
```

**2. "Duplicate entry" errors**
```
# This is normal - IGNORE statements prevent duplicates
# The script will show how many records were actually inserted
```

**3. "Foreign key constraint" errors**
```bash
# Solution: The script handles this automatically
# Tables are created in proper dependency order
```

**4. No data showing in app**
```bash
# Solution: Verify data insertion
php src/test_flashcard_sync.php
```

### **Verification Commands**
```sql
-- Check data counts
SELECT 'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users
UNION SELECT 'dictionary', COUNT(*) FROM dictionary
UNION SELECT 'decks', COUNT(*) FROM decks
UNION SELECT 'flashcards', COUNT(*) FROM flashcards;

-- Check sample deck
SELECT d.name, COUNT(f.id) as cards 
FROM decks d 
LEFT JOIN flashcards f ON d.id = f.deck_id 
GROUP BY d.id, d.name;
```
